# Unnamed Survival Game

## Overview

This game was inspired by an attempt to not agonize over the perfect project idea. The user controls a lone character trying to survive as more and more hazards enter the beautiful plain box that is its home. These attempts will inevitably prove fruitless, but think of the high scores to be achieved!
